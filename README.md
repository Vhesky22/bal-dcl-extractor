Howdy! I'm GI-1 I created this program to extract the newly revised Detailed Core Log of Balabag Project.
Due to database compatibility issue, I create this program to become a translator to our Long time Database format.

To use this program, please create a virtual environment in python.

run this command
> python -m venv your_venv_name

run the requirements.txt using pip 

>pip install -r requirements.txt

This is a test program, feel free to modify!


Happy coding!
